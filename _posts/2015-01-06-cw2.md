## Check the weather
We’ve all skied in various weather conditions and I think we can agree that weather is one of the crucial aspects that affect the level of your skiing enjoyment. After packing your gear the second most important thing you need to do before you go is to check the weather forecast. If you had forgotten to do that before you called your friends and arranged the trip, do it now. It’s painful to cancel the trip due to weather right after you have organized it, but it’s still better than to stand in the parking lot in pouring rain the next day.

There is a big amount of weather apps in the App Store and they all give you the basic information. However, if you want a bit more than these simple functions (and you should), go for [WeatherPro](http://geni.us/37V3) ($2.99). Its predictions are accurate and detailed including weather maps with precipitations, cloud coverage, air pressure and temperature. It can help you to select the resort with the best weather. I’ve been using it for years when planning my skiing trips and it hasn’t ever let me down.

We all know that the weather can change any minute in the mountains. Especially if you are in a larger resort it can take you easily an hour to get to your car.  To avoid encountering bad weather while on the summit I regularly use [MeteoEarth](http://geni.us/3McH) ($2.99). It shows current status and future development of all necessary weather values in a nice layout. It only takes a while to check it while going uphill on a chair-lift. This few seconds helped me plenty of times to get back down just before a snowstorm hit the hill.

## Locate your friends
If you go skiing with your friends, you can be pretty sure that at one time, your group will split. Someone needs a cigarette break, another one needs to use the restrooms and other want to grab some food in the restaurant. For that reason I am using Apple’s [Find My Friends](http://geni.us/19yS) (free) every time I'm going with someone else. You can easily locate the group when you fall behind or your friends can find you if something happens.

## Track your performance
When I was younger, in the years before iPhone and apps, I always spent the evening after skiing checking the non-interactive paper panorama maps to see where I had skied. It was a good relaxation after a hard day on the slopes. Nowadays it’s much more easier to track your skiing, you just need an iPhone, an app and full battery. 
I have tried couple of various apps and my recent favorite is [Slopes](http://geni.us/1XOB) ($4.99). It’s a pretty straightforward app that can be used also for backcountry skiing and it provides incomparably more information than the paper panorama map I was used to. For every run you get your top and average speed, vertical drop, distance and total time. You can also watch your performance on a very nice today widget. Slopes also calculate your burned calories and export them to the Health App. At the end of the day, it shows you a summary of your day with total distance, total time and highlights such as tallest or longest run. It’s fun to sit with your friends in the evening with a cup of tea, compare your results and performance.

## Don’t get bored
Skiing alone has one big disadvantage - one can easily get bored while going uphill if you are not this kind of sociopathic chatty person. To get over the boredom I am now using [PeakFinder](http://geni.us/3IdN) ($3.99). I’ve been always looking around on the chair-lift guessing which mountain is which. With [PeakFinder](http://geni.us/3IdN) I don’t have to guess anymore, because it tells me their names and elevation. Next time you go there with your friends you can impress them with your knowledge.
