perex: Do you remember the time when the first cell phones with camera were introduced? The time when VGA camera was something extraordinary? Sony Ericsson T610 was my first camera phone and it had 0,1 MPx. Boy, how excited I was about it back then! 11 years later we have 8 MPx and optical image stabilization in our newest iPhones.

## Capture it
The native camera app is getting better and better every year and it’s completely sufficient for quick shots. However, if you want more manual control, there is still room for other apps. Right now I am a big fan of [Manual](http://geni.us/r8K) ($1.99). Its name says it all. It brings functions we know from DSLRs to your iPhone. You can, of course, shoot with full automatic mode, but the beauty of [Manual](http://geni.us/r8K) lies in its manual mode. Setting exposure value, shutter speed, focus, sensitivity or white balance is easy as pie. You don’t have to be a professional photographer to enjoy using it.

## Enhance it
Shooting a picture isn’t the end, it’s actually the beginning. Every photo we make can be enhanced right in the iPhone. The most comprehensive and intuitive app I know is [Camera+](http://geni.us/1aOV) ($2.99). It offers all necessary functions for more demanding users who want to tweak their photos to perfection. Straightening, sharpening, saturation and many more. You name a function and [Camera+](http://geni.us/1aOV) has it. For the other, it offers so called scenes which automatically modify the picture to your desire. You can choose concert, beach, scenery, night and dozen more according to your wish. Add inexhaustible range of filters and frames and you have a must-have photo app.

## Print it
You have captured your life moments and you have also added great filters and effects. Now you just need to get them printed! I have been looking for such app for a long time without success. Couple weeks ago it changed. I found [Photolane](http://geni.us/2hJn) (free). It lets you create beautiful photo books in few simple steps. Although the process of creating the book could be a bit friendlier and easier to use, it's still simple enough for everyone. And the result is definitely worth it. The book costs $40 and has 32 pages with up to 100 photos printed in stunning quality. You can rely completely on the app, or you can select layout for each page, add texts or crop photos. I have seen many so-called professional photo books for double the price, but they don't stand a chance compared to my book from [Photolane](http://geni.us/2hJn).
