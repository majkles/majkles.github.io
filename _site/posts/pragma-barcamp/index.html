        <h1 class="headline"><a href="">Pragma Conference and Barcamp</a></h1>

    </header>

    <p>Second weekend in October was very busy with two juicy conferences taking place on Saturday. My two colleagues from Tapmates and me went to Italy to attend <a href="http://pragmamark.org/events/pragma-conference-2014/">Pragma Mark Conference</a> while two other Tapmates members were in Hradec Králové on <a href="http://www.barcamphk.cz/">Barcamp</a>.</p>

<p>Pragma Mark Conference is the only major iOS and OS X development event in Italy. It is held in Milan and many community well-known people gave speech there - <a href="https://twitter.com/MengTo">Meng To</a> (renowned UI/UX designer), <a href="https://twitter.com/icanzilb">Marin Todorov</a> (iOS consultant and publisher) , <a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow">Ash Furrow</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/marcograss">Marco Grassi</a> (mobile security researcher at via Forensics). Last-mentioned speaker had the most valuable presentation for me. He was talking about iOS Apps Security, which is one of the hottest topics right now. Marco showed a few current security issues in iOS apps which are facing some big Italian publishing houses, i.e. La Gazzetta dello Sport. Indeed, to avoid the panic he shared afterwards a couple of ways how the user data could be protected. One would say that such big companies know how to secure their data, but it seems the contrary is the case. Fortunately, henceforth there will be less and less apps with low security level. Another engrossing presentation was the one of Alberto López’s having talked about using Braintree payment method in mobile apps. And my developer colleagues were really excited about Meng To’s iOS Design and Prototyping.</p>

<p>We all enjoyed the conference, but I cannot say the same about Milan. I have never been there and it was the biggest disappointment for me. I know it’s the world capital city of fashion, but I thought there would be something more in the city centre than streets full of clothes stores. Of course there are the Cathedral and the La Scalla and both of them are really beautiful, but I was just expecting more of the historical heritage and less traffic. On the other hand, we tried Airbnb for the first time and it is a great way to know the local way of life and it’s a great break from staying in the stereotypical hotel rooms.</p>

<p>Barcamp Hradec Kralove was the first Barcamp event in my hometown and I am proud that <a href="http://www.tapmates.com/">Tapmates</a> were one of the partners. I have to raise the hat to the organisations of this event. They managed to bring people from <a href="http://www.madfingergames.com/">Madfinger Games</a>, <a href="http://www.warhorsestudios.cz/">Warhorse Studios</a> or <a href="https://www.seznam.cz/">Seznam</a> in really short time. My colleagues enjoyed it and I asked them to pick the best one. Both of them agreed on Jiri Rydl’s presentation about Warhorse Studios’ Kingdom Come. His team spent 4 years visiting publishers who wanted to change the game in order to finance it. At the end the developers decided to go with crowdfunding on Kickstarter and managed to raise 2 million USD. I am looking forward to see videos of the presentation soom. Hopefully, I will manage to attend the next Barcamp as well.</p>
