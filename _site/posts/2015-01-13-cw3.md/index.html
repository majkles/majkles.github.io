        <h2 class="heading"><a href="">Driving better</a></h1>
        <p class="perex-detail">One would be surprised how much time we spend driving our car. What seems like a short one-hour daily commute means 10 days in a car per year and that’s some time.  </p>
    </header>

    <h2 id="get-there-safely">Get there safely</h2>
<p>All drivers know that the most important thing on driving is to get to our destination safely. There are tons of advanced driver assistance systems in new cars to help us. However, you don’t have to throw in the towel, if you don’t have them in your car.
What you need is an app called <a href="http://geni.us/2hMA">iOnRoad</a> ($4.99). It helps you keep a safe following distance and avoid out of lane wandering.  You only need to mount your iPhone on the dashboard and the app does the rest. It will warn you every time you get too close to the car in front of you or whenever your car starts to leave the lane. It might seem unnecessary for a daily commute, but the contrary is the case. You know every inch of the route and you could drive with your eyes closed. You pay less and less attention to the situation around. This is the moment when iOnRoad is a big help and a potential life saver.</p>

<h2 id="drive-where-you-need-to">Drive where you need to</h2>
<p>Getting safely to our destination isn’t the only concern we have while driving. We usually want to get there as soon as possible. There are navigation apps to help us with that. I have tested all offline navigations in the app store and also Google and Apple Maps. Some of them were good, some of them worse. Right now I am driving with Sygic (<a href="http://geni.us/48zT">Europe</a>, $49.99| <a href="http://geni.us/FEb">North America</a>, $39.99) and I find it the best so far. It has all the functions you would expect from a navigation app including very good live traffic based on TomTom data and very accurate ETA. On top you can buy a blackbox feature which records and saves video when an accident happens or additional celebrity voices. Mr. Burns from The Simpsons is a funny co-pilot! Over the time I got used to use Sygic also during my daily commute to help me avoid heavy traffic.</p>

<h2 id="find-a-parking-space">Find a parking space</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge sometimes starts when you get to your destination and you need to find an available parking space. To help me with that I have been using <a href="http://geni.us/11ZO">Parkopedia</a> (free) for a while and I am completely satisfied with it. Obviously, it cannot help you find a parking space on the street but it covers a vast number of parking lots and many of them have also real-time availability info.</p>
